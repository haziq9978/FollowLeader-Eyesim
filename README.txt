W5, Lab Task:
=============
TODO:
1. Individually program a 1 prey vs. 1 predator simulation in the EyeSim software. NO obstacles are considered, use a big (vast space) simulation area. Change the files accordingly, i.e. file settings & program scripts.

2. Record your screen AND yourself doing the work, i.e. use appropriate recording software tool, e.g. Loom - need to signup using UTeM's email address (probably up to 45 mins of recording only). Write your personal details in the txt file & provide the URL to the video of you doing the Lab Task (showing your face & your whole desktop screen).

3. Submit the simulation files together with link/URL to the video that you have recorded in no. 2 via ULearn. zip all these files in the folder, and name the zip file as your matric number.

Note:
a. "Start by signing up for a Loom Starter plan and then request verification of your education status" - https://support.loom.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013870158

b. Loom or any other suitable software that can record the screen AND your face at the same time. It can also be a local installable software that run on your laptop/PC, after which you need to copy the video file onto Dropbox / Google Drive and provide JUST the link together with your submission. TQ!
